# Project TEST repo

Project TEST is a research project that examines
the response modality effects on the spelling performance of Spanish-speaking
elementary-school children.

In this repo we will share the code developed and used in this study.

This research study is directed by Mario E. Bermonti-PÃ©rez, Giselle Cordero-Arroyo from
Ponce Health Sciences University.
